# Dijkstra_Pathfinding_Algorithm
Dijkstra’s algorithm is a popular algorithms for solving many single-source shortest path problems.

Dijkstra’s algorithm is a popular algorithms for solving many single-source shortest path problems having non-negative edge weight in the graphs i.e., it is to find the shortest distance between two vertices on a graph. The algorithm maintains a set of visited vertices and a set of unvisited vertices. It starts at the source vertex and iteratively selects the unvisited vertex with the smallest tentative distance from the source. It then visits the neighbors of this vertex and updates their tentative distances if a shorter path is found. This process continues until the destination vertex is reached, or all reachable vertices have been visited.

Dijkstra’s algorithm can work on both directed graphs and undirected graphs as this algorithm is designed to work on any type of graph as long as it meets the requirements of having non-negative edge weights and being connected.
